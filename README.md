## The Greeneva Project

  

### Idea (Brief Summary)
#### Greeneva Project Overview

Greeneva is a Web and Mobile App, that helps individuals to come together and their personal impact in helping their community and making our world a better place.

With Greeneva individuals can create communities based on their location and solve any Sustainable Development Goals Targets of any Sustainable Development Goal, In a nutshell this means you and I can make an impact in the world no matter how small it is.

Communities in Greeneva can set their targets they will want to achieve and set long term goals to achieve them. Communities may be ranked on how far they go to achieve their set-out targets. Greeneva will fully leverage on SDG #15(Life on Land), SDG #16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG #3 (Good Health and Well-being) The other Sustainable Development Goals will be leveraged on to a certain extent. Partnerships have been made with OneTreePlanted to support SDG #15 (Life on Land).

Individuals will be able to collaborate with social media tools like Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin and WhatsApp to support their community target, spread the word about the App and gather contributors to help their team.
